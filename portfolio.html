	<p>My grandfather was my inspiration to begin in photography. He had a great eye for highlighting subtle beauty in nature. When he gave me his camera, I was instinctively drawn to the outdoors as well; I mean, nature is beautiful. As I practiced new techniques though, I found that I love to capture moments and objects that are difficult to reproduce; either by the aspects of nature itself not repeating or choosing an angle and perspective that others wouldn’t think to admire.</p>
 
	<p>I love being alone to find inspiration. I am an introvert and photography gives me the ability to show a little bit of myself without having to speak. I don’t start out with an end goal in mind. I let objects and settings inspire me. Even when I take the photo, I can start to imagine the end product but I still get a second chance to make the piece into something else entirely in editing. I love to work with focus and light to get a really unique view, then come back and add in additional contrast in the editing process to highlight different areas.</p>

	<p>This portfolio showcases mundane objects in a new light. The photographs have different vantage points and unique perspectives. They feature deep contrasts between dark and light and use subjective focus points throughout. There is a quiet elegance to the world right in front of us if we pause to notice. Some images become abstract in their particular lack of light; others maintain a saturated glow. Though light plays a key role in many images, vantage point remains the primary driving force of this project. Simple structures typically ignored can become center stage with extreme angles and closeups. From parking garages to football stadiums there can be a soft charm to such rough objects; they just need the right point of view. I am most proud that what you may find in these locations is not what I see. This series offers a glimpse to see the world through my eyes.</p>
