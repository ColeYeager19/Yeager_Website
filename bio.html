G. Cole Yeager is a landscape photographer who lives in Fort Collins, Colorado. He
works primarily in Northern Colorado but travels often for work. His love for photography came
from his grandfather who loved to photograph close-ups of nature. Yeager’s work mimics this
when he creates close up shots designed to remind viewers to slow down and analyze the simple
things of life. A flower growing up through rocks, the patina on the ceiling of a parking garage,
or the simple lines of a bench seen from a new vantagepoint showcase his minimalist style.
Rather than finding grandeur in wide views, his work often depicts a quiet solitude.</p>

In Yeager’s first year of college, his natural talent was acknowledged when the president
of his college asked for one of his prints to hang in his office. Shortly after he earned his
Associates of Art degree at the age of seventeen. He would then go on to The University of
	Montana to pursue a Bachelors of Art, with the primary focus on photography.</p>

Yeager worked for film company, Eve Studios, as the lead videographer filming car
commercials. During his time there he refined his knowledge of the Adobe Suite to edit
commercials and prepare social media content.</p>

An artist with a well-rounded skillset, there are few tasks he will be unsuited for.
Between photography, videography, social media management, and graphic design, he has a
wide range of skills that enable him to be successful in this field.</p>
